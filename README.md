# Monte Carlo Tree Search experiments

This repo provides a simple and clean implementation of MCTS for perfect information domains. The main work is due to [kstruempf](https://github.com/kstruempf), whose fork served as my starting point (because I liked the additions he made) and whom I necessarily must thank!

The code within this repo is mostly didactic and useful for my experiments, whatever they may be. If you want to use it, clone the repo and run things locally.

If you want to get the library and use the code (by kstruempf), then check the installation section [here](https://github.com/kstruempf/MCTS).
